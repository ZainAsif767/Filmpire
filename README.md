Filmpire is an application that combines powerful creativity with advanced JavaScript tools such as React.js, Redux, and Material UI. It provides several features including user authentication, dark mode, the ability to sort movies based on categories or genres, view movie and actor details, add films to favorites or watchlists, and many more functionalities.

In addition to these features, Filmpire also has an in-app voice assistant, Alan, which creates user conversational experiences.
